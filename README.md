## C Utils 

# Main purpose
This repository is planned to grow in size with time, and it is intended to have several implementation of functions and tools for C. 
I use C in my own projects and also in work quite often, many times i usually forget useful functions or things that i had created in the past and would be hadny to have them gather all in one repository to avoid having to surf throught all the repositories i once cooperate or created myself in order to find the specific implementation i had done. 

# Additional reasons

As i am a supporter (and heavy user) of free and open source software, i like to contribute in my own way, offering the option for those that may find it useful, to check the source code that i have done. Mainly to provide a different approach or an idea on how to do certain things. In my beginnings i face myself with the fact that finding what i wanted was a heavy task so focusing everything in one single place maybe useful not just for me but also for others.
